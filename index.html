      <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Hello, my name is Karen Joos" width="200">
      <p>Hello! My name is Karen Joos and I am from Utah, United States. I enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles as well as spending time with family and friends. I also enjoy relaxing whether at home or in the outdoors. I was recently remarried this last May to a man whose mother I met after I did a sealing session with my friend. I agreed to go on a blind date with her son in September 2023. I am a mother to an 11 year-old-daughter. My daugher and I enjoy crafting together. The three of us like to go and do paint nights occasionally as well. In the fall I enjoy walking or going for drives around to see all the fall colors in the mountains and valley. I also have a dog named Timber that my daughter talked me into getting in April 2023. I work at a local elementary school helping in the lunchroom as well as helping a couple of grades with math in the afternoon.</p>
